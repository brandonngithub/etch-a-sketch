## ~ etch-a-sketch ~
<p>The fourth project from TheOdinProject (Foundations Course).</p>
<p>A 16x16 sketchpad made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users are able to paint on the sketchpad with any of the 10 colors presented (default being black). Users are also able to reset the sketchpad via the 'Clear' button. In doing this project I was able to expand my knowledge of JavaScript, in particular knowing how to better manipulate the DOM. The biggest hurdle I faced was in shading the grid when the user clicks and drags. This was because clicking and dragging is not a detectable event. I had to create a flag that turned true when the user pressed down and false when the user's mouse button goes up.</p>
